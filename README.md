Here is my new github repository that is build an Chat App with User Map Tracking that i named with '**Kuy! Chat**', i build this app less than a week :D.

In this project i'am using firebase as database. Why ? because Firebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud.

**Note**<br>
If u want develope and take a part to make this app more better, feel free to fork or clone this repository and tag me as creator.

## Requirements
1. This repository, clone into your local disk
2. Firebase Account

## Setting up Firebase

The most important from this app is the database, yes, you must setup the database first at firebase. You can follow the instuctions how to create a real time database here :[Create and Integrating Firebase in React Native](https://www.metizsoft.com/blog/real-time-firebase-integration-with-react-native)
